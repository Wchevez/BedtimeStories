Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Goldilocks. One day, while she was walking in the forest, she stumbled upon a house. It belonged to three bears â€“ Mama Bear, Papa Bear, and Baby Bear.

Goldilocks was curious, so she went inside to take a look. She saw three bowls of porridge on the table. The first bowl was too hot, the second bowl was too cold, but the third bowl was just right. She ate it all up.

Then, she saw three chairs. The first chair was too big, the second chair was too big, but the third chair was just right. She sat on it, but it broke into pieces.

Finally, she saw three beds. The first bed was too hard, the second bed was too soft, but the third bed was just right. She fell asleep.

While she was sleeping, the three bears came home. They saw that someone had eaten their porridge, sat on their chair, and was sleeping in Baby Bear's bed. They were very surprised!

Goldilocks woke up to see the three bears staring at her. She was so scared that she jumped out of bed, ran out of the house, and never returned again.

And from that day on, she always made sure to knock before entering someone else's home! The end.
